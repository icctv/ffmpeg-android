# FFmpeg-android [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/icctv/ffmpeg-android.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/icctv/ffmpeg-android/builds)


This is a fork of [Hitesh Sondhi's FFmpeg-android](https://github.com/WritingMinds/ffmpeg-android), but built without other optional packages. These dependecies have been removed: x246, freetype, libass, lame, libpng, fontconfig, fribidi, expat.

There are [automated builds on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/icctv/ffmpeg-android/builds) for armeabi-v7a, armeabi-v7a-neon and x86 CPU architectures.

We use this software in production on Android 4.0.1 Ice Cream Sandwich, API Level 9 and above.
